\subsection{Detailed Description}
An istream that uses a B\+S\+ON document as a buffer. 

While objects of this class do not own the underlying buffer, they do own the streambuf object associated with it.

By default, istream objects do not delete their streambuffers when they are destroyed, so this class allows one to create a stream without dealing with the underlying streambuf object. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file\+:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
src/boson/bson\+\_\+streambuf.\+hpp\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
